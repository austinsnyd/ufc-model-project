# UFC Fight Outcome Prediction

This project uses machine learning models in R to predict the winner of UFC fights based on pre-fight statistics such as strikes, takedowns, and betting odds.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `analysis/`: HTML versions of the analysis, viewable on GitHub Pages
- `code/`: Source R Markdown (`.Rmd`) files used for each stage of the analysis
- `data/`: Original dataset (`UFC_men.xlsx`)
- `writeup/`: Final PDF write-up summarizing the entire project

## Project Highlights

- Built classification models using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Performed exploratory data analysis and feature engineering
- Evaluated models using metrics like AUC-ROC and F1 Score
- Identified top predictors of fight outcomes

## How to Explore the Project

## üîß Tools Used

- R, R Markdown
- dplyr, ggplot2, tidymodels, xgboost
- GitHub Pages for hosting
